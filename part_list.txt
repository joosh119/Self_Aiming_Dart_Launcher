List of external parts I used in the making of the launcher.
This is not exhaustive, or really even close to complete.

- MG90S Servo: 
- Springs:
- Ultrasonic sensor:
- Small laser:
- MPU??? Gyro Sensor:
- 4x6 perfboard:
- 30 gauge wire (would probably get something much thicker):
- Small paperclip (regular sized ones are too thick to fit in the servo horn holes)
- Various other electronic components
